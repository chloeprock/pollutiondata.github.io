                        <h2>Explanation</h2>
                        <p>
                            The dataset, "World Cities Air Quality and Water Pollution, 2020" was taken from <a target="blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/cityapiio/world-cities-air-quality-and-water-polution">kaggle.com</a>.
                            In the data, the measure for Air Quality varies from 0 (worst quality) to 100 (best quality). The measure for Water Pollution varies from 0 (best quality) to 100 (worst quality). 
                            I created definitions in order to filter for cities with the highest and lowest overall pollution -- aka, <em></em>both their air and water falls into best or worst quality. Cities that don't fall into either best or worst overall are said to have moderate pollution. 
                        <p>
                        <p>
                            The 3 filters and the parameters for their definitions are as follows:
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Cities with highest overall pollution: water pollution must be above 50 and air quality below 50.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Cities with lowest overall pollution: water pollution must be below 50 and air quality above 50.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Cities with moderate pollution levels. If a city has one "high" ranking and one "low" ranking for pollution levels (either air or water), it falls into the moderate category. 
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            The position of each circle on the scatterplot is encoded by Air Quality and Water Pollution levels. When hovering
                            over a circle, the tooltip allows you to find out the location (city, region, and country) of that observation in the data.
                            Based on this, it's possible to explore which cities have the highest, lowest, or moderate pollution levels. 
                            Cities in the top right hand corner of the scatterplot would be considered the worst cities based on the pollution data, 
                            while cities in the bottom left hand corner of the scatterplot would be considered the best cities based on the pollution data.
                            I envision this as a useful tool for exploring cities that might be better or worse to live in/visit based on their pollution levels. 
                            Darker circles indicate that more than one city has that exact value for water pollution and air quality.
